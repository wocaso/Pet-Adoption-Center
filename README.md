# Proyecto AdoptApp - Front End ðŸš€

## The proyect

This page is dedicated to a pet adoption center in Colombia. I worked on it with my team from No Conty as part of a work simulation project we ran in August 2023.

### Technologies Utilized

We developed this on Vercel.js, as our group decided it was the best framework to fulfill the projectâ€™s needs.
